                          The Design Process
                          
1) In this project we need to create database at the entry i.e during signup process, I will have to store the signup information somewhere so                               that I can compare it later when the user logins.
2) When the login id and passward entered is equal to the details when signup info then the submit button will lead to another page where we can see 
   the list of sessions with start and end date.
3) Clicking on any cource will lead to another page where any student can register themself and check the max strength of the session.
4) Registering in each page will lead to another page where some details from students will be taken and stored into the database using mongodb and nodejs.
5) After registering inside the registered cource will allow the student to continue forward with attending the session
